# Advanced_project 

## Project Description
This project was part of the Advanced Control course at the German University in Cairo (GUC). Our team built a quadcopter and implemented Sliding Mode Control (SMC) for stabilization. While the simulations produced promising results, the hardware implementation showed discrepancies due to unmodeled dynamics in the quadcopter and inaccuracies in sensor (IMU) measurements.
